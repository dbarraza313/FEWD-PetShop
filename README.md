My website is a for a dog grooming website. I have included a header bar with an interactive hamburger bar. I have two images which are in a flexbox that switch from horizontal to veritical view. I also incorporated java script in my contact form validation. It wil dispay a confirmation message when a correct email is entered and display an error message when an incorrect email is entered.
